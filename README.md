A repo for playing around with various ML models and concepts.

Tools:
* Python (Pandas, Numpy, Seaborn, GraphViz, Scikit-learn)
* Google Collab

Algorithms:

* **DecisionTreeClassifier**
  * Exploratory Data Analysis *(correlation tables, heatmaps, pairplots)* 
  * KFold Cross-Validation with different criterion *(gini, entropy)*
  * Decision Tree Visualization *(GraphViz)*
  * Pre-pruning and Post-pruning  
 
* **RandomForest** (to be uploaded)
* **GradientBoosting** (to be uploaded)
